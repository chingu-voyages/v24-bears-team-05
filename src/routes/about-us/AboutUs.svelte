	<p>
		We are a set of small teams that share 1 roasting house dedicated to roast
		the best coffee.
	</p>
	<p>
		We realized that the coffee market was full of brands that only cared about
		Instagram aesthetic.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our priority is placed on the coffee our customers buy. We place importance
		in the method of paying everyone involved in this process a fair, liviable
		wage.
